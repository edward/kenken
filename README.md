# kenken

Description<br>
---From Wiki---
<br>KenKen and KenDoku are trademarked names for a style of arithmetic and logic puzzle invented in 2004 by Japanese math teacher Tetsuya Miyamoto,[1] who intended the puzzles to be an instruction-free method of training the brain.

---How do you play?---<br>
<br>The objective is to fill the grid in with the digits 1 through 6 such that:
Each row contains exactly one of each digit
Each column contains exactly one of each digit
Each bold-outlined group of cells is a cage containing digits which achieve the specified result using the specified mathematical operation: addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (×), and division (÷). 

Fun little game in Ruby.
