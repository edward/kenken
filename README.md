##  Description

(Quoted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KenKen)

KenKen and KenDoku are trademarked names for a style of arithmetic and logic puzzle invented in 2004 by Japanese math teacher Tetsuya Miyamoto who intended the puzzles to be an instruction-free method of training the brain.

### How do you play?
The objective is to fill the grid in with the digits 1 through 6 such that:

* Each row contains exactly one of each digit
* Each column contains exactly one of each digit
* Each bold-outlined group of cells is a cage containing digits which achieve the specified result using the specified mathematical operation: addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (×), and division (÷).
